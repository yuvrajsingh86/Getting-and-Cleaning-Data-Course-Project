Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repo contains R Code and instruction Cookbook to understand and create clean data

For this we have used this dataset [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files that you will find in repo

If the data is present in the repo you can check out and run the run_analysis.R file to create clean data

`CodeBook.md` details the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` has all the transformation code of R

The clean file is then generated as `Clean_data.txt`,
